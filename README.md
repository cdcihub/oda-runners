# Federated ODA Workers

## Why?

Providing sufficient computing resources is difficult.

Hence:

**Our goal is to assist in expoloitation of technologies facilitating grows of federation of scientific analysis workflows.**

We provide:

* **knowledge base**: open RDF fact store, explaining relations and provenance of workflows and data.
* **data caching layer**: when necessary, some data will be cached directly on our storage.
