# Federated ODA Workers

## Why Federated Workers?

Providing sufficient computing resources is difficult.

Hence:

**Our goal is to assist in expoloitation of technologies facilitating grows of federation of scientific analysis workflows.**

We provide:

* **frontend**: beutiful and familiar [frontend](https://www.astro.unige.ch/cdci/astrooda_/).
* **data caching**: some data will be cached directly on our storage, and hence re-used by all users.
* **knowledge base**: "open" RDF fact store, explaining relations and provenance of workflows and data. Used to search for relation between workflows and data.

## How do you take part?

* Simply **use our online analysis frontend or API**, leveraging the collective effort of the federation with just few clicks, tracking provenance of our platform.
* **Empower your requests with your own hardware**, computing selected (by you) and verified (by instrument expects whom you trust anyway) analysis workflows. The analysis will store the high-level products in shared provenance-based cache, accelerating similar workflows for the community. Community will see your contribution and will be grateful.
* **Join your own service - a remotely computable workflow** - register it in the Knowledge Base, and find that people will query it more often.
